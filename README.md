**Build intelligent robots that perform human tasks using AI techniques**

## What is this book about?

Artificial Intelligence for Robotics starts with an introduction to Robot Operating Systems (ROS), Python, robotic fundamentals, and the software and tools that are required to start out with robotics. You will learn robotics concepts that will be useful for making decisions, along with basic navigation skills.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Get started with robotics and artificial intelligence
* Apply simulation techniques to give your robot an artificial personality
* Understand object recognition using neural networks and supervised learning techniques
* Pick up objects using genetic algorithms for manipulation
* Teach your robot to listen using NLP via an expert system

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
Sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
Sudo pip install –upgrade pip
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

If you have basic knowledge about robotics and want to build or enhance your existing robot’s intelligence, then Artificial Intelligence for Robotics is for you. This book is also for enthusiasts who want to gain knowledge of AI and robotics.	

I've added wiring diagrams and some pictures of the electronics placement on the robot for fans of the book who are trying to duplicate TinMan the Robot.  There is also arduino code in Chapter 1

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
